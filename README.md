# Proca_vimrc: just another custom vimrc file

This is my current vimrc file setup. I keep adding lines whenever I need more functionalities, preferring this approach to downloading an off-the-shelf advanced vimrc setup.

# Installation

To install my vimrc file after cloning the repository, setting it as your default vimrc, simply execute the ```install``` script as follows:
```
$ cd proca_vimrc
$ ./install
```
The script will scan your home directory looking for an existing vimrc file. Should one already exist, it will be copied in a vimrc.bak file, thus enabling you to recover your own configuration.
