# Proca_dots: just another customised dot-file system

This is my current dot-files setup. I keep adding lines whenever I need more functionalities, preferring this approach to downloading off-the-shelf advanced configuration files.

# Installation

To adopt this configuration setup, after cloning the repository simply execute the ```install``` script as follows:
```
$ cd proca_dots
$ ./install
```
The script will scan your home directory looking for an existing *rc file. Should them already exist, they will be copied in a .*.bak file, thus enabling you to recover your own configuration files. It will then create symlinks to the *rc files from the home directory to ease access to each of them.
